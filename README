HORS11

A hotel reservation system.
Pair project for IS2103

Assumptions
1. Assume that if guest does not check in the 1st day, reservation is released

QUESTIONS CLARIFIED:
1. Confirm rates are absolute amounts & not percentages

Generally is absolute amt


2. Customers can have 1 booking, with multiple reservation across multiple dates for each reservation?
	E.g. Booking 1
		Reservation 1: Deluxe 10/10/18-11/10/18
		Reservation 2: Super 12/10/18-13/10/18

Up to us to decide
As long as can checkout more than one room
Norm is same booking period
Make our own assumptions to be stated in the word document

3. Rates format(by start/end date or weekly, monthly, etc)
	E.g. Weekend/weekly promos vs promos from start date to end date

Can define as day of week (but more difficult)


4. Partners can only have 1 account? Only maximum 1 account login at any time
Multiple ppl can login to the same account

5. Exception report is an entity?

It can be an online statement that you display to user. But you need
to store the records as an entity class to do this.

6. How does system know it is 2am? Must the manager key in time to "auto generate" (start session bean for 2am business methods)

You will be learning the EJB timer service in this week's lecture,
which will shows you how to run time-based scheduled tasks.


Under room type entity:

1. size is what data type

This can be an integer indicating the room size in square meter or
square feet.


2. bed is what data type(assumed is int)

Can just be a string describing the bed(s) in the room type. See
https://www.marinabaysands.com/hotel/rooms-suites.html for an example.

3. capacity is what data type

Again, this can just be a string. See the MBS example above.

4. Amenities is what data type

Can be string too.

When partners make a booking, it is for the partner’s customer (there is a difference between guests and partner’s customers)

Partner record MUST be separated
